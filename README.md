# db8iot - db8 Internet of Things
===============

### Some of my Internet of Things (IoT) experiments with:
- Hardware
   - Raspberry Pi
   - Arduino
   - ESP8266
- Components   
   - LEDs
   - LED Matrix with MAX7219 LED display driver IC
   - DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor
   - DS18B20 temperature sensor
- Software   
   - C++ (for Arduino / ESP8266)
   - Python (for Raspberry Pi)
   - Joomla plugins
   - WordPress plugins - **Note**: the code is **not** a good example of 
a WordPress plugin. WordPress development is new to me and I did not have time enough 
to dig into plugin parameters + default values. Consider it as a proof-of-concept which uses **hardcoded parameters** 
(Pull Request are welcome! :-)
